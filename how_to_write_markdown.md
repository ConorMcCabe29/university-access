# How to write MarkDown
## Headings
 - To create titles/headings in MarkDown you must use # Symbol.
 - A single # is a main heading.
 - A double ## is for a sub heading.
 - When writing a heading you must make sure to put a space after the #.


## Lists
- Using - you can create lists of bullet points.
  -  By putting two space before the - you can indent the point to make it a sub point.
 * [ ] By using this * [ ] we can create a tick box to us in lists.
 1. By using normal numbers with a dot you can create numbered lists.

## Formatting
 - To make a word/sentence bold you need to put ** on either side of the what you what bold.
   - Like this **Bold**
 - To make a word/sentence Italic you need to put a single * on either side of the what you what Italic.
   - Like this *Italic*
 - When writing in MarkDown as well you need to put a full line in space to go down to the next line.
 - To do a strike through on a work/line you need to put ~~ on either side of the work/line.
   - ~~Like this~~
- To highlight a word put == on wither side.
  - ==Like this==

## Insert
-  To create a hyperlink in MarkDown you need to put a description in square brackets then the link in round brackets right after the square brackets.
   - An example here [Google](https://www.google.com/)
- To insert an image into the MarkDown you need to do the same as a hyperlink but before the square brackets with no space in between place an !  Example below:

## Viewing 
There are a few other way to look a things in a MarkDown file and I'll show the methods below.

- First would be quotes all you need to do is start a new line with > and that'll make it a block quote.
> This is an example of block quotes.
- Next would be to view code in MarkDown, to do this you need to place ` on either side of the code and press tab at the start of line.
     - 	`print("Hello World!")`
-  Next would be tables, Tables are created through a series of | and - .
   - |This   |  is | an | example | of | a | Table |
     |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 
    - Tables can be as long and tall as you like you just need to add more | and - .
  # The END.
