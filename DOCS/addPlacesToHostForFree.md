# Free places to host applications online for free
## [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
Netlify provides 100GB of space free of charge for 1 project. Any more than than and you need to upgrade to monthly payment.
## [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
Extremely easy to use it just clones the Github repository and runs it. I tried and it took less than 30 seconds to setup.
## [Fly](https://fly.io)
Fly is very easy to install, The follow screengrab shows how. ![](../../../Pictures/fly.png)
## [Stormkit](https://stormkit.io)
This is still completely free as the others but personally out of all of them I think this is the worst.

# Conclution
After trying all of them for a few minutes to get the hang of them I personally prefer Fly or Vercel.
